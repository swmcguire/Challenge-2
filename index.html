            <h1>About</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota.  I graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison in 2007.  I have worked as an Implementation Consultant for the last seven years at Thomson Reuters for a live benchmarking software.  I have recently started taking coding classes to advance my career.  I currently write custom SQL scripts for large law firms and their accounting systems but I am looking to take that skillset and morph it into something more with the knowledge I gain over the next six months in my coding classes.

                <p>
                    In my spare time I love to play golf and try to get out on my bicycle as often as possible.  My wife and I are in the middle of a kitchen remodel and are doing it ourselves.  It has been quite the adventure but we keep moving forward and the finish line is insight.

                        The PreWork you'll see here is a studyguide that helped me to learn a bit more about coding:  It has notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub.  Going into this project I had seen this type of coding but had never tried to attempt it on my own.  While this project was mostly guided, it was helpful to see before we dove in head-first.

                            Project-1 was our first look at a potential "Real-World Employer Situation" - We were given a pre-written .html file and .css file and we had to debug the html and cleanup the css.  This project was very interesting and fun, as this is kind of an offshoot of what I do in my day to day business life.  Only I am operating in a SQL environment but overall, same process.

                            Project-2 is still in the works, as I am writing as I go.  This project has proven to be much more difficult as I am having to come up with the code on my own.  It has definitely been a learning experience and I understand why 20+ hrs a week have to be devoted to outside class work.  Another thing that was realized is that I'm not sure I am a fan of the website design process.  Writing code, I am enjoying a lot, however deciding what color needs to be where is not necessary my fortay.

                            Class Project-1 turned out to be an amazing learning experience.  I got paired up with some great guys.  We had some ups and downs but managed to put together a solid project.  We designed a website that connects to a food and drink API that will populated food/drink choices based on ingredients you have lying around.  Once you have a decision you can add that to a shopping list so you are ready to go.  This project used APIs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate what we've learned thus far.
