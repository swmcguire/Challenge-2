# Challenge-2

## Description

The goal of this challenge is to create a portfolio site that highlights the work that I have done in class, so that, when the class is complete I will have a legup on other competition.  Since most employers will need a "book of work" this will act as my online repository for class projects.  

This project is just a start as we only have two projects completed.  However, as the course goes on, the portfolio site will be updated with new skillsets that I have acquired.

I look forward to updating my portfolio on an ongoing basis to keep my projects up-to-date as well as make modifications to the overall site design, CSS and JavaScript.

## Installation

No installation needed - can launch the site by visiting:  https://swmcguire.github.io/Challenge-2/.

Once there please take a look at my book of work and see what you think.

## Usage

The usage of the website is to display my current work and ongoing work.  This will eventually grow into a more robust website showcasing all my work and morph into a cleaner more functional site highlighting all of my newfound skills.
