                <p class="text-size">
                    I was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota.  I graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison in 2007.  I have worked as an Implementation Consultant for the last seven years at Thomson Reuters for a live benchmarking software.  I have recently started taking coding classes to advance my career.  I currently write custom SQL scripts for large law firms and their accounting systems but I am looking to take that skillset and morph it into something more with the knowledge I gain over the next six months in my coding classes.

                    In my spare time I love to play golf and try to get out on my bicycle as often as possible.  My wife and I are in the middle of a kitchen remodel and are doing it ourselves.  It has been quite the adventure but we keep moving forward and the finish line is insight.
